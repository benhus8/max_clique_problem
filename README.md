# max_clique_problem

The project was created to combine the subject of combinatorial optimization during the 3rd semester at the Poznan University of Technology. The algorithm presented in the clique_problem file allows you to find the largest cliques in a graph with disjoint vertices. In addition, functions have been implemented that enable the visualization of the examined graph, as well as allowing for batch processing or loading data from a Json file.
